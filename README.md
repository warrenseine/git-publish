# git-publish

Push stacked atomic Pull/Merge Requests.

# What is this?

`git-publish` is a Python script that manages your stacked commits into separate PR (GitHub) / MR (GitLab). It assigns a change ID to each commit in the commit message through a commit message hook. When calling `git-publish` directly, each commit will be pushed to a dedicated remote branch and PR / MR will be created targeting the right branch to retain the commit history. If commits are amended, `git-publish` will refer to the change ID to find the associated branch and keep everything in order.

# Get started

Install `git-publish` for everyday use:

```sh
$ uv tool install git-publish
```

For local development of this repo:

```sh
$ uv build
$ uv tool install . -e
```

Set the required environment variables (add to your shell profile) or rely on the token resolver:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` â€” required for GitHub projects (repo scope sufficient for PRs). The tool will also accept `GH_TOKEN`, or fall back to `gh auth token` and Git credential helper.
- `GITLAB_TOKEN` â€” required for GitLab projects (api scope)
- `GITLAB_URL` â€” optional GitLab instance URL; default: `https://gitlab.com`
- `GITPUBLISH_BRANCH_PREFIX` â€” optional branch/id prefix; defaults to your OS username
- `GITPUBLISH_CHANGE_ID_PREFIX` â€” prefix used in commit messages for change ids; defaults to `Change-Id:`

You can also drop these in a local `.env` file at the repo root; it will be autoâ€‘loaded when you run the tool:

```env
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com
GITPUBLISH_BRANCH_PREFIX=alice
GITPUBLISH_CHANGE_ID_PREFIX=Change-Id:
```

Run it in your repository:

```sh
$ git-publish
```

Tips:

- You can also run it as a Git subcommand: `git publish` (Git will invoke `git-publish` on PATH).
- Make sure you are on one of the main branches (`main`, `master`, `development`, `develop`) and that it is up-to-date with its tracking branch.
- After commit, check the commit message contains a line like `Change-Id: user/1a2b` (or your chosen prefix).

# Hooks

When you run the tool, it installs a `commit-msg` hook at `.git/hooks/commit-msg` that ensures a Changeâ€‘Id is present in every commit.

- Update: re-run `git-publish` to validate the existing hook content.
- Remove: `rm .git/hooks/commit-msg`.

# Safety

This tool will:

- Stash and later unstash your working tree when dirty
- Forceâ€‘push ephemeral branches (one per commit)
- Delete temporary local branches after publishing

Make sure your main branch is clean and tracking the correct remote.

# Development tasks

Using the task runner:

```sh
$ uv run task lint    # ruff (check) + pyright
$ uv run task format  # ruff --fix
$ uv run task test    # pytest
```

# Troubleshooting

- "Branch is not upâ€‘toâ€‘date with its tracking branch" â†’ `git fetch` then `git pull --ff-only`.
- "Must be on a main branch" â†’ switch to `main`, `master`, `development`, or `develop`.
- "Empty GITHUB_TOKEN/GITLAB_TOKEN" â†’ export in your shell or add to `.env`.

## Dev containers and CI-friendly token resolution

`git-publish` now resolves the GitHub token in this order:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) environment variable
2. `gh auth token` if the GitHub CLI is installed and logged in
3. Git credential helper (`git credential fill` for `github.com`)

This works well in VS Code tasks and dev containers where environment variables may not be present.

Dev container task example:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "git-publish",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-lc",
        "GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token 2>/dev/null || true) git publish"
      ],
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Alternatively, add a `.env` file in the workspace (not committed) with `GITHUB_TOKEN=...` which the tool autoâ€‘loads.
